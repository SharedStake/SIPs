**SharedStake Improvement Proposals (SIPs)** describe standards for the SharedStake Decentralized Autonomous Organization.

## SIP Types
- Governance Operations - Proposals for improving the DAO operations, Governance, Partnerships and other social events.
- Core - Proposals that affect the core functionality of SharedStake.
- Contracts - Improvements on SharedStake Contracts including gas efficiency, security, reliability etc. Functional changes and core implementations should take place in Core Proposals.
- Interface - Proposals that improve the User Experience and User Interface. These proposals may include Core proposals with smaller effects. Visual changes on the [main website](https://www.sharedstake.org/) should take place as an issue in the [UI repositoryâ†—](https://github.com/SharedStake/SharedStake-ui)
- Meta - Improvements on SIPs, see [SIP-1](SIPS/sip-1.md)

Before you begin writing a formal SIP, you should vet your idea with the SharedStake community. Ask if an idea is original to avoid wasting time on something that will be be rejected based on prior research. When you believe your SIP is mature and ready to progress, ask to have your issue added to the next governance call where it can be discussed for inclusion in a future platform upgrade. If the community agrees to include it, the SIP Editors will update the state of your SIP to 'Approved'.

If your SIP requires images, the image files should be included in a subdirectory of the `assets` folder for that SIP, using the following nameing convention: `assets/sip-X` (for sip **X**). When linking to an image in the SIP, use relative links such as `../assets/sip-X/image.png`.
